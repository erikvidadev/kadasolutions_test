## About The App
 ```bash
    This RESTful API created implements a simple task management system that allows users to create, read, update and delete tasks. 
    In the system, each task has a title, description, creation date, due date and status, which can be for example pending, in progress or completed.
    During development, we use the Python programming language and choose the FastAPI or Django framework to create the API. 
    The SQLite database will be used to store the data. The task model will be defined with the required fields such as title,
    description, creation date, due date and status, which can be populated with predefined values.
    CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) are provided to handle the tasks, and input validation and error handling are carefully implemented. 
    In addition, the system provides the possibility to filter and sort tasks by status, creation or due date, in both ascending and descending order. 
    This functionality provides greater flexibility and user-friendliness in the management of tasks.
